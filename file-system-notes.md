# File System Notes

## Five useful Linux commands

### 1. `pwd`
Prints the full path of the current directory so you always know where you are.

### 2. `ls -lah`
Lists files and folders in long format, including hidden files, permissions, owners, and readable file sizes.

### 3. `cd`
Moves between directories. Example:

```bash
cd /var/log
```

### 4. `find`
Searches for files and folders by name, type, or other filters. Example:

```bash
find . -name "*.log"
```

### 5. `less`
Lets you open large files and scroll through them safely without printing everything at once. Example:

```bash
less /var/log/syslog
```

## Practice examples

```bash
cd /var/log
ls -lah
pwd
touch test.txt
mkdir -p projects/demo
cp test.txt projects/demo/
mv projects/demo/test.txt projects/demo/backup.txt
rm projects/demo/backup.txt
```
